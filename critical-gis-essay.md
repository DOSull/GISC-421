# Critical GIS essay
**due 5pm, Monday 26 April** submit to the dropbox provided on Blackboard.

An essay of one of the following three topics:
1. Explain what you understand by the term 'critical GIS'. Why do you consider it important that geospatial professionals take the ideas underpinning critical GIS seriously?
2. The 'power of maps' is widely acknowledged. How does this concept apply to GIS and other geospatial platforms?
3. Can GIS adapt to account for non-Western knowledge and ways of representing the world (if so then how, and if not then why not)?

More information will be provided on this theme in a number of the Wednesday lectures, particularly in the first half of the semester.

Useful readings are provided in a number of items in the [Blackboard folder associated with this assessment](https://blackboard.vuw.ac.nz/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_2960996_1&course_id=_111562_1).

These are organised under headings of ethics, critical GIS, the power of maps, and non-Western knowledges.

**Word limit:** 2500 words, excluding reference list

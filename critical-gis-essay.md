# Critical GIS essay
**due 5pm, Monday 26 April** submit to the dropbox provided on Blackboard.

An essay of one of the following three topics:
1. Can GIS adapt to account for non-Western knowledge and ways of representing the world (if so then how, and if not then why not)?
2. The 'power of maps' is widely acknowledged. How does this concept transfer across to GIS and other geospatial platforms?
3. Explain what you understand by the term 'critical GIS'. Why is it important that geospatial professionals take the ideas underpinning critical GIS seriously?

More information will be provided on this theme in a number of the Wednesday lectures, particularly in the first half of the semester.

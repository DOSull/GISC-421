#### GISC 421 T1 2021
# Critical GIS essay
**due 5pm, Monday 26 April** submit to the dropbox provided on Blackboard.

An essay of one of the following three topics:
1. What does ethics have to do with GIS? In answering this question consider two examples where ethical considerations might exert an important influence on a project. [Only one of the examples may relate to privacy.]
2. Explain what you understand by the term 'critical GIS'. Why do you consider it important that geospatial professionals take the ideas underpinning critical GIS seriously?
3. The 'power of maps' is widely acknowledged. How does this concept apply to GIS and other geospatial platforms?
4. Can GIS adapt to account for non-Western knowledge and ways of representing the world (if so then how, and if not then why not)?

More information will be provided on this theme in a number of the Wednesday lectures, particularly in the first half of the semester.

Useful readings are listed below. Where links are to library hosted sources, you may need to be on campus, or be required to log in to the libary. Where possible and an open resource exists, I have used such resources.

## Critical GIS
This is a nice introduction, although annoyingly the e-version has almost no figures...

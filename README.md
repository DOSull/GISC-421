# GISC 421 GIS Applications and Impact
This course provides an overview of applications of Geographic Information Science in New Zealand and internationally. Through field teaching, individual and group work, and guest lectures from industry professionals, students will gain a strong understanding of the dimensions of the geospatial industry from data collection, to storage, analysis and dissemination. Specific attention will be given to organisations’ use of and impact on GIS; ethics; and how GIS fits within organisations, the economy, communities, and its impacts on their decision making.

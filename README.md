## Overview
This course provides an overview of applications of Geographic Information Science in New Zealand and internationally. Through field teaching, individual and group work, and guest lectures from industry professionals, students will gain a strong understanding of the dimensions of the geospatial industry from data collection, to storage, analysis and dissemination. Specific attention will be given to organisationsâ€™ use of and impact on GIS; ethics; and how GIS fits within organisations, the economy, communities, and its impacts on their decision making.

## Field trip 26-28 Feb
An outline of the three day (two night) residential field trip is posted [here](field-trip/overview-and-requirements.md), along with the [timetable](field-trip/timetable.md) (not yet finalised).

## Schedule of guest lectures and meetings
These are in the Buchanan Room at 12PM on Wednesdays, unless otherwise noted. Details are subject to change as the trimester unfolds, so check Blackboard regularly for any updates.

### Class representatives
Since this is a relatively small graduate class, I expect that it will not be a problem to raise any issues or concerns directly with me, or with the GIS technician.

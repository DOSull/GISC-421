#### GISC 421 T1 2021
# The postgraduate programme structure
## Postgraduate Diploma
### _Required classes_
+ **GISC 420 Geographical Computing** T1
+ **GISC 421 GIS: Applications and Impact** T1

and three or four from
+ **GISC 422 Spatial Analysis & Modelling** T1
+ **GISC 423 Cartography & Geovisualization** T2
+ **GISC 424 Remote Sensing** T1
+ **GISC 429 Internship** usu. T2

### Highly recommended
(and **required** if you are considering Masters options)
+ **GEOG 580 Research Preparation** T2

Then make up to 120 points (8 courses) from

### Various electives
Ask us about options. There are various courses in the school in geography and earth or environmental science that may be relevant and of interest. Two that students often consider are
+ **PHYG 419 Natural Hazards and Risk: Processes & Impacts** T2
+ **PHYG 420 Water Resources** T2

Less obviously, students in the programme *frequently* take one or two of these
+ **DATA 471 Practical Data Scienc** T2
+ **SCIS 410 Science Communication** T1
+ **STAT 451 Official Statistics** T2

## Masters options
You have to complete all the above programme of study, _including_ **GEOG 580** with a satisfactory (B+) grade, and research plan. Then there are two masters pathways.

#### Either
180 point Masters in GIScience, which involves a summer ('T3') research project (**GISC 511**) or placement and research project (**GISC 512**). The timeline for either of these is *very tight*.
#### Or
A full year Masters by thesis. 

## Postgraduate Certificate
This is essentially half of the Diploma, with an emphasis in GISC classes, i.e., **GISC 420 and GISC 421** and **two** from **GISC 422-424**.

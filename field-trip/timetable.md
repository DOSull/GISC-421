# Timetable for Otaki Field Trip
Times are approximate, but it's a tight schedule and we will endeavour to stick to it!

### Update in alert level 2
Timetable for the field trip is under constant review. Day 1 is more or less correct (or expected to be at the time of writing 16 Feb). Later days are subject to change at short notice.

## Planned activities
We have a number of different activities planned. Normally these would all be scheduled and there would be a fairly precise timetable. This year due to both COVID alert level uncertainties and unpredictable weather, here, instead is a list of the activities and an attempt to show how the various contingencies will play out.

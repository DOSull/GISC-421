# Otaki Forks field trip
As you should be aware, we start the programme with a 3-day field trip as part of GISC 421 (Applications and Impact of GIS). The field trip starts on Wednesday 17 February 2020 (the week before trimester 1), and will visit the beautiful Otaki Forks and Kāpiti Coast.

During the field trip, we will intersperse lectures, discussions and getting to know you with a UAV (drone) survey, deployment of sensors, and on Friday a trip to the Wairarapa to consider the use of GIS and geospatial technologies in the context of a number of inter-related projects around Wairarapa Moana.

**The field trip details are below. Please read them carefully. This is a residential field trip that will involve two nights away from Wellington.**
